# multiball
Six Esri CityEngine rules combined into one for high-variety scenes. Import all top-level directories into your workspace. Drag and drop `Multiball/rules/muli.cga` onto any shapes (lots/inner lots/streets) to execute. I hacked bits of code everywhere to create medium-high resolution geometry and avoid the white people/trees that were introduced in 2019.0.

You will need to ensure that `Esri.lib` and `ce.lib` are present in your workspace. They usually are.
