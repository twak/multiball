# multiball
Six Esri cityengine rules combined into one. Drag and drop `Multiball/rules/multi.cg` onto any shapes (lots/inner lots/streets) to execute. Hard coded to create medium-high resolution geometry and avoid the white 

You will need to ensure that `Esri.lib` and `ce.lib` are present in your workspace.
